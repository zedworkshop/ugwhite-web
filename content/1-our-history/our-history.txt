Title: Our History

Athens: 

For nearly a century U.G. White Mercantile has benefited and served as an economic anchor for downtown Athens. Farmers, cotton mill workers and businessmen alike purchased horse drawn plows, cast iron skillets and everything in between.

U.G. White maintains its presence as the trailhead of the once again thriving square in Athens, AL. Having passed from four family generations to the current owners, U.G. White continues to offer quality goods and provisions, fair prices and impeccable customer service.

Thereâ€™s something for everyone at U.G. White Mercantile. Now with a location in Elkmont, and coming soon to Downtown Huntsville.
