Title: Our History

----

Athens: 

For nearly a century U.G. White Mercantile has served as an economic anchor for downtown Athens. Farmers, cotton mill workers and businessmen alike purchased horse drawn plows, cast iron skillets and everything in between.

U.G. White maintains its presence as the trailhead of the once again thriving square in Athens, AL. Having passed from four family generations to the current owners, U.G. White continues to offer quality goods and provisions, fair prices and impeccable customer service.

There's something for everyone at U.G. White Mercantile with locations in Athens (since 1917) and Huntsville.

Huntsville: Now open in downtown Huntsville, AL at 115 Clinton Ave E, one block north of the courthouse square. It is everything you love about our original location in Athens on a larger scale.

Summary: For nearly a century, U.G. White Mercantile has benefited and served as an economic anchor for downtown Athens, Limestone County, and now Huntsville, AL.
